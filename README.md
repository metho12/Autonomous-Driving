# Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

Welcome to the Week 3 programming assignment! In this notebook, you'll implement object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: [Redmon et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and [Redmon and Farhadi, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242). 

**By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to**:

- Detect objects in a car detection dataset
- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
- Implement intersection over union
- Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning

## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader

Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:

1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.
2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.
3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.
4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.
5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.
